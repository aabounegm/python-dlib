# Python-dlib Docker image

This repo hosts a Docker image for the [dlib C++ library](https://github.com/davisking/dlib), based on the official Python image for use with libraries such as [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) (it is actually based on the example Dockerfile there).

It is based on [python:3.8-slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/python), and installs dlib v19.21. If different versions are needed, pull requests or issues are welcome.
